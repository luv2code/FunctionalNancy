Funtional Nancy
===============

This project is a wrapper around the .net based Nancy micro web server.  
Nancy is modelled after the Sinatra web server for ruby.

I wrote this to experiment with making a single page web app with an FSharp backend.

To get started, just open controller.fs and start hacking.  
I've included some basic operations.

You could also reference this dll in a different project and use the NancyExt to make creating 
Nancy Modules just a little bit easier.
